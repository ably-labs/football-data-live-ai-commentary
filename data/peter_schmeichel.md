## Trivia, Controversies & Comedy Gold

- **Goalkeeper who scores:** Netted **11 career goals**, including a flying header for Aston Villa and multiple for Brøndby in the Danish Cup – perfect for “he fancies himself as a striker” jokes.  
- **Size XXXL shirts:** United kitman custom‑ordered his jerseys; opponents claimed he *“filled the goal.”*  
- **Vocal leader:** Famous for roaring at defenders; Gary Neville has said the hair‑dryer from Schmeichel was scarier than Sir Alex’s.  
- **Son vs Father:** His son Kasper is also a Euro‑winning Danish No.1; joking lines about “family business.”  
- **Love of Metallica:** Once admitted he warmed up to heavy‑metal playlists – imagine him air‑guitaring in goal.  
- **Euro 92 legend:** Denmark only entered because Yugoslavia were banned; two weeks later Schmeichel lifted the trophy – an underdog fairy tale ripe for comedic callbacks.  
- **1991 Back‑flip celebration:** Pulled a gymnast flip after a rare goal, nearly flattened a teammate.  
- **1999 Treble final:** His cartwheel in front of the fans as United scored two stoppage‑time goals – immortal GIF fodder.  
- **Massive Throw‑Range:** Could hurl the ball 60 m – jokes about “NFL draft prospect.”  
- **TV Host:** Post‑retirement fronted Scandinavian versions of *“Only Fools on Horses”* and even appeared on *Strictly Come Dancing* Denmark – plenty of banter about twinkle‑toes.
