# Live AI Sports Commentary Demo

Experience the future of sports broadcasting where AI-powered insights meet realtime delivery at scale. This demo showcases how modern realtime infrastructure like [Ably](https://ably.com) can transform static data into dynamic, engaging fan experiences.

## üöÄ Why This Matters

[The Premier League recently unlocked 30 years of match data](https://aimagazine.com/news/how-microsoft-is-powering-the-premier-league-with-ai). Microsoft and Copilot can now tell fans anything about players, clubs, or matches. But unless that information arrives **in the moment** - on mobile, on broadcast, in chat, at scale - it's just trivia.

This demo shows what's possible when you combine:
- **Rich historical data** (player stats, performance history)
- **Low-latency AI processing** (OpenAI with streaming responses)
- **Realtime delivery at scale** ([Ably's global edge network][https://ably.com/network])

The result? AI commentators that react to live events within seconds, delivering contextual insights that reference player histories, team dynamics, and match statistics - all while showing the "thinking" process in realtime.

## üéØ What This Demo Shows

Built in just a few hours, this proof of concept demonstrates:

- **Sub-second event propagation** - Match events trigger AI commentary instantly
- **Streaming AI responses** - See commentators "think" in realtime with live cursors
- **Stateful conversations** - Commentary builds on previous events for natural flow
- **Data-driven insights** - Every comment references actual player stats and history
- **Scalable architecture** - Ready to handle millions of concurrent fans
- **State synchronization** - Join mid-game and get the full context instantly

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

### The Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Ably's realtime SDKs
- **Backend**: Node.js server managing game state and AI orchestration
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 with custom prompts and streaming responses
- **Realtime**: Ably for pub/sub messaging, presence, and state sync
- **Data**: Pre-loaded player statistics and match history

### Key Features

1. **Live Game Simulation**
   - Interactive 5-a-side football match
   - Click to trigger events (goals, fouls, assists)
   - Server-managed game timer and state

2. **AI Commentary Pipeline**
   - Events are batched intelligently (4-second window)
   - OpenAI processes events with full game context
   - Responses stream token-by-token to clients
   - Commentary maintains conversation history

3. **Realtime Architecture**
   - Game state on `football-frenzy:main` channel
   - Commentary on `football-frenzy:commentary` channel
   - Automatic history replay on page refresh
   - Presence tracking for connected fans

## üé® The Experience

Watch as Barry Banter and Ronnie Roast, our AI commentators, bring the game to life:

- **Barry** provides play-by-play with statistical insights
- **Ronnie** adds color commentary with personality
- Both reference actual player data in their commentary
- See them "think" with animated cursors before speaking

## üí° Why Ably?

This demo leverages Ably's unique capabilities:

- **Global Edge Network**: 635+ PoPs ensuring <65ms latency worldwide
- **Guaranteed Ordering**: Commentary chunks arrive in sequence
- **History API**: New viewers get full game context instantly
- **Scalability**: From 10 to 10M fans without infrastructure changes
- **Reliability**: 99.999% uptime SLA with automatic failover

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- An [Ably account](https://ably.com) with an API key
- An [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com) with an API key

## üò¶ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ably-labs/football-data-live-ai-commentary.git
cd football-data-live-ai-commentary
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Copy the example environment file to create your local configuration:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` and add your API keys:

```env
# Ably API Key for real-time communication
ABLY_API_KEY=your-ably-api-key

# OpenAI API Key for AI commentary generation
OPEN_AI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

**Important**: Next.js only loads environment variables from `.env.local` (not `.env`). The `.env.local` file is already in `.gitignore` and should never be committed to version control.

### 4. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## üìä Sample Data

The AI commentators reference real player statistics loaded from [`server/data/players/`](server/data/players/). Each player has:
- Career statistics (goals, assists, cards)
- Playing style descriptions
- Notable achievements
- Personality traits for commentary flavor

Example player data files:
- [Cristiano Ronaldo](server/data/cristiano_ronaldo.md)
- [David Beckham](server/data/david_beckham.md)
- [Steven Gerrard](server/data/steven_gerrard.md)
- [Thierry Henry](server/data/thierry_henry.md)
- [Peter Schmeichel](server/data/peter_schmeichel.md)

## üß† AI Prompts

The commentary system uses carefully crafted prompts to create engaging, contextual commentary. View the [commentary system prompt](prompts/commentary-system.md) to see how we:
- Maintain commentator personalities
- Reference player statistics naturally
- React appropriately to different events
- Keep commentary concise for realtime delivery
